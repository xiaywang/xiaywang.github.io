Course co-responsible and lecturer at Integrated Systems Laboratory from 2020 to 2022.\
This course was jointly created by Michael Hersche and I in 2020. We created the lecture slides and designed the lab exercises. I then led the course until 2022.\
This course teaches signal processing and machine learning techniques applied to brain-computer interfaces by having hands-on experience in brain signal acquisition, data processing, feature extraction, and machine learning.
