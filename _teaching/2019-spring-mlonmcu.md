Course coordinator and assistant at Integrated Systems Laboratory from Feb 2019 to Jun 2020.\
I contributed to the creation of slides for two lectures and led eight lab exercises.\
This course gives an overview of machine learning methods and algorithms to process and extract useful near-sensor information in end-nodes of the Internet-of-things. We use low-power microcontrollers/processors based on ARM Cortex-M and RISC-V.
