I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in biomedical engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Italy and ETH Zurich, Switzerland in 2016 and 2018, respectively.
I have successfully defended my Ph.D. dissertation entitled "Near-sensor analytics and machine learning for wearable biomedical systems" on November 29, 2022. 
I conducted my Ph.D. studies in the group of Digital Systems and Circuits under the lead and supervision of Prof. Dr. Luca Benini in the Integrated Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, ETH Zurich.
I received an **Excellent paper award** in IEEE International Conference on E-health Networking, Application and Service (HEALTHCOM) in 2018 and the **Ph.D. Fellowship** from the Swiss Data Science Center in 2019.

My research interests include biosignal processing, low-power embedded systems, energy-efficient smart sensors, brain--machine interfaces, and machine learning on microcontrollers.
