I have an interdisciplinary background thanks to my studies in Biomedical Engineering (Laurea cum Laude at Politecnico di Milano, M.Sc. Bioimaging track at ETH Zurich) covering a broad range of areas including biological methods, chemistry, physiology, neuroinformatics, bioimaging techniques, computer vision, electronics, and data science. 
I have acquired expertise in machine learning and deep learning during my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Luca Benini in the Integrated Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, ETH Zurich. My Ph.D. dissertation is entitled “Near-Sensor Analytics and Machine Learning for Wearable Biomedical Systems”.
I received an **Excellent paper award** in IEEE International Conference on E-health Networking, Application and Service (HEALTHCOM) in 2018 and the **Ph.D. Fellowship** from the Swiss Data Science Center in 2019.
My research interests include biosignal processing, brain--machine interfaces, energy-efficient wearable devices, edge computing, machine learning, and deep learning.

Despite the seemingly diverse paths I have taken so far, my motivational drive has always been the same: improve the health and well-being of all. With the acquired technical knowledge in data science and engineering, I would like to go closer now to the patients and make a real-life impact in healthcare for those in need. I believe that my interdisciplinary background will allow me to become a perfect bridge between clinicians and data scientists and engineers.
