I have an interdisciplinary background thanks to my studies in Biomedical Engineering (Laurea cum Laude at Politecnico di Milano, M.Sc. Bioimaging track at ETH Zurich) covering knowledge in biological methods, chemistry, physiology, neuroinformatics, bioimaging techniques, computer vision, electronics, and data science. 
I have become an expert in machine learning and deep learning during my Ph.D. in electrical engineering, with focus on biosignals acquisition and analyses using wearable devices. My Ph.D. dissertation is entitled "Near-sensor analytics and machine learning for wearable biomedical systems" under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Luca Benini in the Integrated Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, ETH Zurich.
I received an **Excellent paper award** in IEEE International Conference on E-health Networking, Application and Service (HEALTHCOM) in 2018 and the **Ph.D. Fellowship** from the Swiss Data Science Center in 2019.
My research interests include biosignal processing, brain--machine interfaces, edge computing, energy-efficient smart sensors, machine learning, and deep learning.

Despite the apparent diverse paths I have taken sofar, my motivational drive has always been the same: good health and wellbeing for all. With the acquired technical knowledge in data science and engineering, I would like to go closer now to the patients and make a real-life impact in healthcare for those in need. I believe that my interdisciplinary background will allow me to become a perfect bridge between clinicians and data scientists and engineers.
